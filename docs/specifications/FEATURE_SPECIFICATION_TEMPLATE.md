## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Component Overview
*A brief, one-sentence description of what this component does and why it exists in the pipeline.*

### 1.2 Pipeline Integration
*How this component fits into the MEARA pipeline.*
- **Input**: What file(s) this component receives from the previous step (e.g., `Deep_Research_Brief.txt`, `master_analysis.md`).
- **Output**: What file(s) or modifications this component produces for the next step (e.g., a new `master_analysis.md`, an appended section to `master_analysis.md`).
- **Dependencies**: Any knowledge base files (`.md` from `docs_framework/`) this component relies on.

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

### 2.1 In Scope
*A clear, bulleted list of what this component WILL do.*
-
-
-

### 2.2 Out of Scope
*A clear, bulleted list of what this component will NOT do to prevent scope creep.*
-
-

### 2.3 SLC Success Criteria
*How we measure the "Simple, Lovable, Complete" quality of this component.*
- **Simple**: The component has a single, clear responsibility and a minimalist interface (CLI/file I/O).
- **Lovable**: The component provides clear status feedback and its output is 100% reliable for the next step ("Perfect Handoff Confidence").
- **Complete**: The component is functionally correct, handles expected errors, and passes all its tests.

## 3. Core Logic & User Flow

### 3.1 Primary Flow
*The main "happy path" for the component's execution.*
1.  Read input file(s).
2.  Load required knowledge base file(s).
3.  Execute core logic (e.g., call Gemini API with a specific prompt).
4.  Write or append to the output file(s).
5.  Provide a clear success message.

### 3.2 Error Flows
*How the component handles failures.*
- **Invalid Input**: If an input file is missing or malformed, provide a clear error and stop.
- **Processing Failure**: If an API call fails, log the error from the API and stop.

## 4. Technical & UX Constraints

### 4.1 Technology Constraints
*Required technologies, APIs, or libraries.*
- **AI Interaction**: Gemini CLI
- **Orchestration**: n8n (for the final automated pipeline)
- **File Formats**: Markdown, JSON, HTML, JavaScript

### 4.2 User Experience Constraints
*The "user" is the developer running the tests or the n8n workflow.*
- **Progress Indication**: CLI output should be clear and indicate the current stage of processing.
- **Error Messaging**: Errors must be descriptive and suggest a potential cause or fix.
- **Logging**: All output should be logged for debugging purposes.

## 5. Test Plan

### 5.1 Unit Tests
*Specific tests for individual functions or prompts.*
- **Test Case 1: Happy Path**: Test with a valid, well-formed input file. Expected result: A correctly formatted output file.
- **Test Case 2: Malformed Input**: Test with a missing or empty input file. Expected result: A clear error message and a non-zero exit code.

### 5.2 Integration Tests
*Testing the handoff between this component and the previous/next one.*
- **Integration Test 1**: Use the actual output from the *previous* pipeline step as the input for this component. Expected result: Successful processing without modification.

### 5.3 Validation Tests
*Testing against our core principles.*
- **SLC Validation**: Does the component meet the success criteria defined in section 2.3?
- **Experience Goal Validation**: Does using this component align with our goals of "Confidence" and "Empowerment"?

## 6. Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Key Tasks
*A high-level checklist of tasks to complete this component.*
- [ ] Write the prompt file (`prompt_[task_id].txt`).
- [ ] Write the Gemini CLI command for testing.
- [ ] Execute tests for all cases defined in the Test Plan.
- [ ] Refine the prompt until all tests pass.
- [ ] Document the component in the future `ComponentLibrary.md`.
