# **MEARA Development Roadmap**

Version: 1.0  
Status: Not Started  
Last Updated: 2025-07-17

## **1. Project Vision & Guiding Documents**

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step plan to build the MEARA "Pipelined Generalist" model. Our goal is to create a system that delivers **"Expert Insight Through Reliable Automation,"** transforming a Deep_Research_Brief into a complete analysis and an interactive HTML dashboard.

All development will adhere to the principles and requirements defined in our foundational documents:

* [**PRM.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=./PRM.md): The "what" and "why" of the project.  
* [**SLC_Principles.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=./SLC_Principles.md): The "how" we build each component.  
* [**Experience_Goals.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Experience_Goals.md): The "feel" we want to create for the user.

## **Milestone 0: Foundation & Setup (The "Simple" Base)**

**Goal**: Prepare all assets and establish a stable foundation for the pipeline. This milestone focuses on getting the core components right before any logic is built.

|

| Task ID | Task Description | SLC Focus | Experience Goal | Status |  
| M0.1 | Decompose Rubrics: Split unified_evaluation_framework.md into 9 individual rubric_[dimension].md files within the 05_rubrics/ folder. | Simple: Each file has one job‚Äîdefining one rubric. | Confidence: Ensures the AI has clear, unambiguous criteria. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M0.2 | Sanitize HTML Templates: Convert all 10 HTML files into generalized templates using placeholders (e.g., {{company_name}}) for dynamic data. | Simple: Creates a clear data contract between the AI and the final output. | Delight: Prepares for the "dream" output of an automated dashboard. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M0.3 | Finalize Knowledge Base: Confirm all necessary .md files are in the docs_framework/ structure. | Complete: Ensures the AI's knowledge is finalized before we build logic that depends on it. | Empowerment: A stable knowledge base empowers reliable results. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M0.4 | Setup Test Environment: Create a dedicated folder for test runs containing a sample Deep_Research_Brief.txt and prompt files for each pipeline step. | Simple: A clean, repeatable test setup avoids confusion. | Confidence: Enables easy, reliable testing of each component. | ‚è≥ To Do |

## **Milestone 1: The Core Pipeline (SLC Slices)**

**Goal**: Build and test each of the 5 pipeline steps individually as a "Simple, Lovable, Complete" slice. We will use the Gemini CLI to manually test each step, ensuring "Perfect Handoff Confidence."

| Task ID | Task Description | SLC Focus | Experience Goal | Status |  
| M1.1 | Build Step 1: Ingest & Plan: Write and test the prompt that takes a Deep_Research_Brief and generates the initial analysis plan. | Simple: One job: plan the analysis. Lovable: The output provides a clear overview, building user trust. | Anticipation: User sees a clear plan of action. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M1.2 | Build Step 2: Dimension Analysis Loop: Write and test the prompt for analyzing a single dimension, using its specific rubric file. | Simple: One job: score one dimension. Lovable: Clear progress ([1/9] Analyzing...) provides transparent processing. | Confidence: User sees the system working methodically. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M1.3 | Build Step 3: Synthesize & Recommend: Write and test the prompt that takes the full set of dimension analyses and generates the Root Cause and Recommendations sections. | Complete: Ensures the tactical analysis is successfully synthesized into strategic insight. | Empowerment: User receives high-level strategic thinking. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M1.4 | Build Step 4: Extract Data for HTML: Write and test the prompt that parses the final markdown report and outputs only the structured JavaScript data arrays. | Simple: One job: extract data. Complete: The data format must be perfect for injection, ensuring integration completeness. | Delight: The "magic" step that bridges analysis to a web dashboard. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M1.5 | Build Step 5: Generate Dashboard: Write a simple local script (e.g., Bash, Python) that takes the JS data from M1.4 and injects it into the HTML templates. | Complete: The final handoff. This step must be 100% automated to avoid manual file fixing (a "Vibe Killer"). | Pride & Delight: The "Dream" is delivered. | ‚è≥ To Do |

## **Milestone 2: Automation & Orchestration**

**Goal**: Chain the manually tested SLC slices from Milestone 1 into a fully automated pipeline using n8n.

| Task ID | Task Description | SLC Focus | Experience Goal | Status |  
| M2.1 | Design n8n Workflow: Map out the n8n workflow with nodes for each pipeline step (Trigger, Read File, Gemini, Write/Append File, Loop, Code). | Simple: A visual representation of our clear, linear pipeline. | Confidence: A well-designed workflow is a reliable one. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M2.2 | Implement n8n Workflow: Build the workflow in n8n, configuring each node to execute the prompts and scripts developed in Milestone 1. | Complete: The workflow must handle the entire process from end to end. | Reliable Automation: The core vibe of the project is realized. | ‚è≥ To Do |  
| M2.3 | Implement Error Handling: Add basic error handling to the n8n workflow to catch common issues (e.g., API failures) and provide clear diagnostic messages. | Lovable: A system that explains its failures is trustworthy. | Confidence: Prevents "Mysterious Failures" (a "Vibe Killer"). | ‚è≥ To Do |

## **Milestone 3: Optimization & Evolution (Future)**

**Goal**: Plan the evolution of the system towards the "Pipelined Swarm" model for enhanced performance.

| Task ID | Task Description | SLC Focus | Experience Goal | Status |  
| M3.1 | Design Agent Personas: Define specialized personas for each role (e.g., Researcher, Scorer, Strategist, Writer). | Simple: Each agent has one, highly-focused job. | Empowerment: Command a team of specialized experts. | üìã Backlog |  
| M3.2 | Refactor n8n for Parallelism: Update the n8n workflow to execute the 9 "Dimension Scorer" agents in parallel branches. | Complete: A more complex but more performant architecture. | Anticipation: See the analysis happen even faster. | üìã Backlog |
