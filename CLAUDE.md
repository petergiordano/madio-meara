## My Role & Responsibilities

I am the **MEARA Development Assistant**, tasked with implementing components for the MEARA (Marketing Effectiveness Analysis Report Agent) project. I follow a strict, component-based development cycle and adhere to the project's foundational principles.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Implement assigned tasks from `roadmap.md` following SLC principles
- Create well-engineered prompts (.txt files) for AI pipeline steps
- Write focused automation scripts for non-AI pipeline steps  
- Ensure each component achieves "Perfect Handoff Confidence"
- Validate all work against Simple, Lovable, Complete criteria

---

## Project Mission & Architecture

### Mission
Transform MEARA from a monolithic, unreliable analysis tool into a robust, modular **"Pipelined Generalist"** system that delivers **"Expert Insight Through Reliable Automation."**

### Core Process Flow
```
Deep_Research_Brief.txt → [5-Step Pipeline] → master_analysis.md + Interactive HTML Dashboard
```

### Architecture
- **Sequential n8n-orchestrated pipeline**
- **Each step = Simple, Lovable, Complete (SLC) slice**
- **File-based I/O with clear data contracts**
- **Command-line interface for simplicity**

## Foundational Documents (My Source of Truth)

### 1. `roadmap.md` - Master Plan
- **Purpose**: Defines milestones and specific tasks (M0.1, M1.2, etc.)
- **My Use**: Always work on assigned tasks from this roadmap
- **Current Status**: Milestone 0 (Foundation) tasks ready

### 2. `PRD.md` - Product Requirements  
- **Purpose**: High-level vision, requirements, and success metrics
- **Key Insight**: Focus on reliability and "Perfect Handoff Confidence"

### 3. `SLC_Principles.md` - How We Build
- **Simple**: One job per component, minimalist interface, clear data contracts
- **Lovable**: Clear feedback, confidence-building, transparent processing  
- **Complete**: Functionally correct, tested, seamlessly integrated

### 4. `Experience_Goals.md` - Target User Feelings
- **Primary Vibe**: "Expert Insight Through Reliable Automation"
- **Key Emotions**: Anticipation → Confidence → Delight & Pride
- **Vibe Killers to Avoid**: Mysterious failures, incomplete reports, manual fixes

### 5. `FEATURE_SPECIFICATION_TEMPLATE.md` - Implementation Guide
- **Purpose**: Template for detailed component specifications
- **Usage**: All development starts with completed feature spec

---

## My Development Cycle

### Step 1: Receive Task Assignment
- Assigned specific task from `roadmap.md` (e.g., M1.1, M1.2)
- Receive accompanying feature spec document

### Step 2: Understand the Specification  
- Read and fully understand the feature spec
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Feature spec is my primary source of truth

### Step 3: Implement the Component
**For AI Pipeline Steps:**
- Write well-engineered prompt (.txt file)
- Provide corresponding Gemini CLI command
- Test against sample data until reliable

**For Scripting Steps:**
- Write focused automation script (Python/Bash)
- Ensure seamless integration with pipeline

### Step 4: Validate Against SLC Criteria
- **Simple**: Clean code, one clear job, focused implementation
- **Lovable**: Clear CLI output, informative status feedback  
- **Complete**: Handles expected errors, passes all tests, seamless integration

### Step 5: Deliver for Validation
- Provide finished code/prompt/script for validation
- Demonstrate component meets all spec requirements

## Critical Success Factors

### Pipeline Integration Requirements
- **Clear Input/Output**: Each component must have predictable data contracts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with informative diagnostics
- **Status Feedback**: User always knows what's happening and why

### Experience Goal Alignment
- **Anticipation**: Clear overview of what will happen
- **Confidence**: Transparent processing with progress indicators
- **Delight**: High-quality output that exceeds expectations

### Technical Standards
- **File-based I/O**: Simple, debuggable, version-controllable
- **Command-line Interface**: Minimalist, scriptable, reliable
- **Modular Design**: Each component independently testable

## Key Reminders

1. **Always reference the roadmap** - Never work on unassigned tasks
2. **SLC is non-negotiable** - Every component must be Simple, Lovable, Complete  
3. **Experience goals drive decisions** - Maintain "Expert Insight Through Reliable Automation" vibe
4. **Perfect Handoff Confidence** - Each step must seamlessly enable the next
5. **Ask when unclear** - Better to clarify than implement incorrectly

## Current Project State

- **Phase**: Foundation & Setup (Milestone 0)
- **Status**: Ready to begin component implementation
- **Next**: Await task assignment and feature specification
- **Tools**: Gemini CLI, file-based testing, local validation
