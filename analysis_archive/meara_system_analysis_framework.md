## Complexity Assessment Framework

### Document Complexity Scoring
- **Basic (1-2)**: Simple instructions, minimal decision logic
- **Intermediate (3-5)**: Moderate complexity, some conditional logic
- **Advanced (6-8)**: Complex workflows, multiple decision points
- **Expert (9-10)**: Sophisticated analysis, advanced methodology

### Capability Sophistication Scale
- **Level 1**: Basic information processing
- **Level 2**: Structured analysis with templates
- **Level 3**: Multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks
- **Level 4**: Strategic integration and advanced methodology
- **Level 5**: Expert-level analysis with novel approaches

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Document Interdependency Mapping
```
Document A → [Influences] → Document B
Document B → [Provides Context For] → Document C
Document C → [Validates Against] → Document A
```

### Workflow Integration Points
```
Stage 1: [Initial Analysis]
  ↓ [Uses Documents: X, Y]
Stage 2: [Deep Assessment]
  ↓ [Uses Documents: Y, Z]
Stage 3: [Strategic Synthesis]
  ↓ [Uses Documents: A, B]
Stage 4: [Final Reporting]
```

## MADIO Template Prediction Framework

### Template Requirement Indicators

**Core Templates (Always Required):**
- Any AI system → `project_system_instructions`
- Multi-step process → `orchestrator`

**Analysis Templates:**
- Structured evaluation → `methodology_framework`
- Scoring/rating systems → `rubrics_evaluation`
- Strategic assessment → `strategic_framework`
- Research validation → `research_protocols`

**Content Templates:**
- Consistent voice/authority → `character_voice_authority`
- Content validation → `content_operations`
- Standardized outputs → `standard`

**Specialized Templates:**
- Visual requirements → `visual_design_standards` + `visual_asset_generation`
- Implementation planning → `implementation_roadmap`
- Complex relationships → `document_reference_map`
