## Project Mission

Convert MEARA (Marketing Effectiveness Analysis Reporting Agent) from Google Docs-based Claude Project/Gemini Gem implementation into a comprehensive MADIO-start framework while preserving all capabilities and identifying framework enhancement opportunities.

## MEARA System Overview

**Current Implementation:**
- Platform: Claude Project + Gemini Gem
- Foundation: Google Docs knowledge base
- Primary Function: Marketing Effectiveness Analysis and Strategic Reporting
- Complexity Level: Enterprise-grade analytical capabilities

**COMPLETE SYSTEM ANALYSIS (5/5 Documents):**
- ✅ System Instructions (v4) - Expert-level persona authority with sophisticated integration
- ✅ Instruct_Marketing_Analysis (v1.1) - Most complex orchestration document in MADIO ecosystem
- ✅ Marketing Analysis Methodology - **MOST SOPHISTICATED PROCESS FRAMEWORK** - 8-step systematic methodology with Level 5 complexity
- ✅ Marketing Analysis Rubrics - **MOST COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK** - 9-dimension, 4-level scoring with Level 5+ breakthrough innovations
- ✅ **Strategic Elements Framework - STRATEGIC QUALITY ASSURANCE CAPSTONE** - 8-element strategic verification with Level 5 expert sophistication
  - **Strategic Opportunity Preservation**: Systematic prevention of critical insight loss
  - **Deep Research Brief Integration**: "Breakthrough Spark" and "Revelatory Angles" coordination
  - **AI Engine Optimization Assessment**: Industry-first AEO evaluation framework
  - **Strategic Quality Assurance**: Cross-methodology verification and implementation excellence
- ✅ **FINAL ASSESSMENT**: **Level 5+ Enterprise Strategic Analytical System** requiring 18-20 MADIO templates + 5 NEW template categories
- ✅ **UNPRECEDENTED SOPHISTICATION**: Academic research-grade standards with strategic verification + quality assurance

## MADIO Template Requirements

**Mandatory Core Templates (100% Required):**
- ✅ `project_system_instructions` (Tier 1) - Expert persona authority + integration requirements
- ✅ `orchestrator` (Tier 2 v1.1) - Layered reporting + cross-dimensional impact mapping

**Analysis Templates (95% Confidence Required):**
- ✅ `methodology_framework` - 8-step systematic analysis process 
- ✅ `rubrics_evaluation` - 9-dimension evaluation with 4-level scoring + cross-dimensional mapping
- ✅ `strategic_framework` - Strategic integrity verification preventing insight loss
- ✅ `research_protocols` - Evidence collection with mandatory web research + citation standards

**Integration & Quality Templates (80-85% Confidence):**
- ✅ `document_reference_map` - Complex 4+ document interdependency management
- ⏳ `content_operations` - Evidence integrity + quality validation protocols
- ⏳ `character_voice_authority` - Senior CMO-level expertise embodiment
- ⏳ `implementation_roadmap` - 4-phase execution with priority matrix

**Total Estimated Templates: 18-20** (vs 8 for "Who Would Win" project - **+150% complexity increase**)
**Framework Enhancement Required: Academic research-grade standards + strategic verification + 5 NEW TEMPLATE CATEGORIES**

**Confirmed New Template Categories Required:**
1. **Cross-Dimensional Analysis Framework** - Root cause vs. symptom identification with relationship mapping
2. **Stakeholder Reporting Architecture** - Progressive disclosure with Executive/Strategic/Tactical layers  
3. **Implementation Sequencing Framework** - Phase-based resource allocation with dependency management
4. **Visual Documentation System** - Relationship maps, cascade diagrams, severity visualization, priority matrices
5. **Strategic Quality Assurance System** - Strategic verification protocols and Deep Research Brief integration

**Complete Framework Architecture Transformation:**
- **Analytical Sophistication**: From content generation to Level 5+ enterprise strategic analysis
- **Evaluation Excellence**: From basic scoring to 9-dimension, 4-level comprehensive assessment + strategic verification
- **Integration Complexity**: From simple references to sophisticated 5-document orchestration
- **Quality Assurance**: From basic validation to academic research-grade + strategic preservation protocols
- **Strategic Capabilities**: From tactical recommendations to breakthrough opportunity identification + implementation

## Document Conversion Strategy

**Phase 1: Discovery and Mapping**
```
MEARA Google Doc → Analysis → MADIO Template Selection → Conversion Plan
```

**Phase 2: Template Creation**
```
Content Extraction → MADIO Formatting → Cross-Reference Integration → Quality Validation
```

**Phase 3: System Integration**
```
Template Assembly → Workflow Testing → Platform Optimization → Deployment Preparation
```
