### 2. Resource Allocation Framework

#### Team Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Marketing | Product Marketing | Web/Dev | Design | External |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | 40% | 20% | 10% | 10% | 20% |
| 2 | 30% | 40% | 20% | 30% | 0% |
| 3 | 50% | 30% | 10% | 20% | 20% |
| 4 | 40% | 20% | 30% | 10% | 30% |

#### Budget Allocation Guidelines
- Phase 1: 10% (mostly internal effort)
- Phase 2: 25% (messaging and design)
- Phase 3: 35% (content creation)
- Phase 4: 30% (amplification and tools)

### 3. Priority Matrix Integration

**Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)**:
- Implement within Phase 1-2
- Resource allocation: 20%
- Examples: Homepage headline, CTA updates, G2 profile

**Strategic Initiatives (High Impact, High Effort)**:

- Resource allocation: 60%
- Examples: Category positioning, journey orchestration

**Consider Items (Low Impact, Low Effort)**:
- Implement if resources available
- Resource allocation: 15%
- Examples: Minor UX fixes, social updates

**Avoid Items (Low Impact, High Effort)**:
- Defer or eliminate
- Resource allocation: 5%
- Examples: Complete rebrand, custom tools
