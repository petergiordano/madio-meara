# Root Cause Analysis System

## Purpose
Systematically identify fundamental marketing ineffectiveness causes through cross-dimensional pattern recognition, cascade effect mapping, and document integration management.

## Template Metadata
- **Template ID**: root_cause_analysis_system
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Dependencies**: unified_evaluation_framework, comprehensive_methodology
- **Required By**: orchestrator, strategic_analysis_framework, reporting_and_visualization

## Core Components

### 1. Root Cause Identification Framework

#### Common Root Cause Patterns

**ICP Misalignment**
- Messaging targets multiple, conflicting audiences
- Value propositions address generic pain points
- No clear firmographic or technographic focus
- Different pages target disconnected audiences

**Positioning Weakness**
- Generic value claims applicable to competitors
- Feature-focused rather than outcome-focused messaging
- No clear unique differentiation articulation
- Inconsistent positioning across channels

**Buyer Journey Gaps**
- Content heavily weighted to one funnel stage
- Missing middle-funnel consideration content
- No clear path from awareness to conversion
- Single high-friction conversion point

**Conversion Architecture Flaws**
- High-commitment CTAs for low-intent visitors
- Unclear next steps after content engagement
- Mismatched CTAs relative to journey stage
- Unnecessary information or steps required

**Visibility & Discoverability Breakdown**
- Weak SEO presence for category terms
- No AI Engine Optimization (AEO)
- Limited third-party validation
- Poor review platform presence

**Message Inconsistency**
- Disjointed language across channels
- Visual brand inconsistency
- Voice and tone variations
- Conflicting value propositions

**Analytics Blind Spots**
- No measurement feedback loop
- Poor funnel clarity
- Attribution gaps
- Missing KPI definitions

**Underleveraging Proven Assets**
- Past achievements not featured
- Strong historical content buried
- Positive sentiment not leveraged
- Unique narratives not integrated

**Inadequate Competitive Defense**
- Branded terms targeted by competitors
- No counter-strategy for competitor claims
- Lack of "Why Us vs. Them" content
- Reactive rather than proactive positioning

### 2. Cross-Dimensional Impact Mapping

#### Impact Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Affects 5+ dimensions or core business metrics
- **High**: Affects 3-4 dimensions with revenue impact
- **Medium**: Affects 2 dimensions with efficiency impact
- **Low**: Affects 1 dimension with limited scope

#### Relationship Type Identification
- **Causal**: Root cause directly creates dimension problems
- **Dependency**: Dimension issues cannot be fixed until root cause addressed
- **Bidirectional**: Dimension and root cause mutually reinforce

#### Documentation Format
```
Root Cause: [Title]
Business Impact: [Revenue/growth/competitive effect]

Cross-Dimensional Impact:
- Dimension 1: [CRITICAL] - [Manifestation description]
- Dimension 4: [HIGH] - [Manifestation description]
- Dimension 6: [MEDIUM] - [Manifestation description]

Supporting Evidence:
- "[Quote]" — [Source: URL]
- "[Quote]" — [Source: URL]

Implications: [If unaddressed]
```

### 3. Cascade Effect Analysis

#### Cascade Pattern Template
```
Trigger: [Initial Issue] in [Dimension]
   ↓
Primary Impact: [Effect] in [Dimension]
   ↓
Secondary Impact: [Effect] in [Dimension]
   ↓
Tertiary Impact: [Effect] in [Dimension]
```

#### Example Cascade
```
"Unclear Value Proposition" (Root Cause)
    ├─▶ Poor conversion (Dimension 1: Positioning)
    │      ├─▶ High CAC (Business Impact)
    │      └─▶ Long sales cycles (Dimension 2: Journey)
    │
    └─▶ Weak differentiation (Dimension 6: Competitive)
           ├─▶ Price competition (Business Impact)
           └─▶ Low win rates (Dimension 8: Analytics)
```

### 4. Document Reference Integration

#### Cross-Document Dependencies
- Methodology Step 3 findings → Root cause inputs
- Root causes → Strategic recommendation drivers
- Strategic elements → Root cause validation
- DRB insights → Root cause context

#### Reference Integrity Management
```
Finding Source: [Document/Step]
Root Cause Mapped: [Yes/No]
Strategic Element Link: [If applicable]
Recommendation Coverage: [Yes/No]
```

### 5. Deduplication Framework

#### Cross-Reference Rules
1. If issue explained as root cause, don't repeat in symptoms
2. Reference primary analysis location for secondary appearances
3. Use "See [Root Cause Name]" notation
4. Maintain visibility without redundant explanation

#### Completeness Validation
- [ ] All dimensions reviewed systematically
- [ ] Cross-dimensional patterns identified
- [ ] Root causes trace to all manifestations
- [ ] Strategic implications captured
- [ ] No redundant explanations

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Pattern Recognition
1. Review all dimension findings from unified_evaluation_framework
2. Identify issues appearing in 3+ dimensions
3. Cluster related observations
4. Distinguish symptoms from causes

### Step 2: Root Cause Synthesis
1. Consolidate clusters into 3-5 root causes
2. Validate against DRB insights
3. Assign business impact ratings
4. Document supporting evidence

### Step 3: Impact Mapping
1. Map each root cause to affected dimensions
2. Rate severity for each manifestation
3. Identify relationship types
4. Document cascade effects

### Step 4: Strategic Validation
1. Cross-reference with strategic_analysis_framework
2. Ensure strategic opportunities addressed
3. Validate no insights lost
4. Confirm business relevance

### Step 5: Documentation
1. Create visual relationship map
2. Complete root cause profiles
3. Verify cross-references
4. Prepare for recommendations
