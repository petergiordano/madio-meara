## Framework Purpose

This document provides comprehensive instructions for conducting marketing effectiveness analyses. It serves as the primary execution guide for MEARA, coordinating all analysis activities and ensuring consistent, high-quality outputs.

## Analysis Objective

## Deep Research Brief Integration

Throughout analysis, actively reference and integrate the user-provided "Deep Research Brief for [Company Name]" (DRB):

- **Validate, Verify & Expand**: Use DRB findings to inform investigation, then validate through independent web research
- **Contextualize Rubric Scoring**: Let brief insights inform ratings and assessments
- **Inform Root Cause Analysis**: Connect symptoms to deeper contextual factors from brief
- **Seed Strategic Recommendations**: Develop Strategic Imperatives and Breakthrough Sparks into full recommendations
- **Address Non-Obvious Dynamics**: Investigate indirect competitors, market fault lines, and GTM hypotheses
- **Evidence Responsibility**: All final report evidence must come from YOUR direct investigation

## B2B SaaS Marketing Assessment Criteria

Apply these industry-specific criteria:
- **Review Platform Strategy**: Assess G2, Capterra, TrustRadius presence and optimization

- **Security & Compliance Signals**: Assess trust establishment for enterprise buyers
- **SEO/AEO Tactical Check**: Evaluate foundational on-page SEO and AI Engine Optimization signals

## AI-Native Marketing Assessment

For AI companies, apply additional scrutiny:
1. **AI Authenticity Test**: Would company appear AI-driven without "AI" terminology?
2. **Technical Credibility Signals**: Sufficient technical content to establish credibility?
3. **Internal Detractor Consideration**: Does messaging address resistance and concerns?
4. **Urgency Creation**: Clear, compelling "why now" messaging?
5. **AI Competitive Positioning**: How well positioned against AI and non-AI alternatives?
6. **Presentation Style**: Does website structure align with tech-leading company norms?
7. **Nuanced AI 'Feel'**: Does overall presence evoke genuine AI nativity?
