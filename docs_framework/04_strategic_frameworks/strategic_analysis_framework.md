### 3. Strategic Verification Process

#### Strategic Elements Verification Table

| Strategic Element | Opportunity Exists? | Evidence | Priority | Related Root Cause |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Category Definition | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Competitive Defense | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Underleveraged Assets | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Urgency Creation | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Buying Committee | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Tech Authenticity | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| AEO Readiness | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |
| Tactical Excellence | Yes/No | [Evidence] | High/Med/Low | [Root Cause] |

#### Priority Classification Logic
- **High**: Breakthrough potential + immediate business impact
- **Medium**: Strategic importance + medium-term value
