# MEARA → MADIO Framework Conversion Project

## Project Overview

This project converts the MEARA (Marketing Effectiveness Analysis Reporting Agent) from its current Google Docs-based Claude Project/Gemini Gem implementation into a comprehensive MADIO-start framework.

### What is MEARA?
MEARA is a sophisticated Marketing Effectiveness Analysis Reporting Agent that provides:
- Complex marketing analysis capabilities
- Strategic evaluation and reporting
- Multi-dimensional assessment frameworks
- Evidence-based recommendations

### What is MADIO?
MADIO (Modular AI Declarative Instruction and Orchestration) is a production-ready framework with 14 standardized templates organized in a hierarchical structure:
- **Tier 1**: `project_system_instructions` (mandatory)
- **Tier 2**: `orchestrator` (mandatory) 
- **Tier 3**: 12 supporting templates for content, analysis, visual, and implementation needs

## Project Status

**Phase**: Environment Setup Complete
**Next Step**: MADIO Research and MEARA Documentation Analysis

## Key Files

- `MEARA_MADIO_CONVERSION_MAPPING.md` - Master conversion strategy document
- `analysis/meara_system_analysis.md` - Comprehensive MEARA capability inventory
- `mapping/madio_template_requirements.md` - MADIO template selection and justification
- `implementation/conversion_roadmap.md` - Phase-by-phase execution plan

## Conversion Methodology

This conversion follows the proven methodology used for the "Chronicles of Khronexia: Who Would Win" project, adapted for MEARA's marketing analysis complexity.

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Capability Preservation**: All MEARA functions maintained in MADIO format
2. **Framework Enhancement**: Identify opportunities to improve MADIO templates
3. **Production Readiness**: Deployable across OpenAI CustomGPT, Gemini Gem, and Claude Project
4. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation strategy
